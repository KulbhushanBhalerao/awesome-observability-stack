# Summary
This document outlines the design and implementation plan for setting up a scalable, highly available, and cost-efficient observability stack for monitoring multiple Kubernetes clusters. The stack will provide separation of data based on use cases, support derived calculations, ensure actionable alerting, and enable integration with CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure as code (IaC).

# Next Steps (Contributions)

Add all the IaC, helm/kubernetes yamls so that we can deploy this stack on any cloud (AWS, AKS, GKE) environment and have this solution implemented.
